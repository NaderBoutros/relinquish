The Digital Building Design Knowledge Sharing Impulse - Relinquish - is a non-profit initiative for collecting, connecting and communicating knowledge on the digital built environment. We believe the greatest unfulfilled potential in the building design industry lies in the connected brains of all the people who do great research every day without sharing it with others.
